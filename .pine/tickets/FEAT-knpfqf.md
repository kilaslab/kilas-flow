## Scope

Every secret in KilasFlow lives in one place and arrives by one route. `internal/config/config.go` exposes a single `Security.EncryptionKeyEnv`, and `cmd/kilasflow/main.go` reads the AES-256-GCM master key with `credentials.KeyFromEnvironment`, which is `os.Getenv` behind a length check. Credential values are sealed with that key into `credentialModel.Payload`, and `GORMCredentialStore.Resolve` is, by its own comment, "the single path by which a plaintext secret leaves storage". PRD §34 asks for more than that in one sentence — "Master key must come from environment or external secret manager" — and only the first half was ever built.

For the product's stated ICP this is a blocker rather than a nicety. A white-label host embedding KilasFlow into their SaaS already runs Vault, AWS Secrets Manager or their cloud's equivalent, has a rotation policy, and has auditors who ask where the keys are. Telling them the master key is an environment variable on the container, and that every downstream API token is a row in the workflow database, ends the conversation. It is also operationally worse than it looks: rotating a secret today means editing a credential through the API in every deployment that uses it, because nothing here can follow a reference.

This ticket adds two related but distinct mechanisms, and they must not be conflated. The first is the *master key source*: the key that opens the credential cipher may come from a secrets manager instead of the environment. The second is *credential values by reference*: a stored credential field may hold a pointer into a manager rather than a sealed secret, resolved on the way out at the moment the runtime needs it. The first is a boot-time concern with one consumer; the second is a per-execution concern with a cache, a failure mode and a tenancy rule.

Tenancy is the rule that shapes the second mechanism. `credentialModel` carries `tenant_id` and every repository call takes a `TenantScope`; an external reference must be resolved inside that scope, against a manager binding that belongs to that tenant. A provider configured once at the process level, with tenant-authored reference strings pointed at it, is a cross-tenant read waiting to happen.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The credential master key can be sourced from an external secrets manager instead of `Security.EncryptionKeyEnv`, and the environment path keeps working unchanged for deployments that do not configure one.
- [ ] A manager that is configured but unreachable at boot refuses startup with a named error. It never degrades to the "no key configured" path, which disables credential storage.
- [ ] A credential field can hold a reference into a manager instead of a sealed value, and it is resolved on the existing `Resolve` path so no new route exists by which plaintext leaves storage.
- [ ] A manager binding belongs to a tenant, and a reference authored under one tenant cannot read a secret bound to another — proven by test.
- [ ] Resolved values are cached in memory with a bounded, configurable TTL, are never written to disk, and are dropped when the credential or the binding changes.
- [ ] A value fetched from a manager never reaches an execution record, an API response, or a log line — including when it is interpolated into an HTTP request body rather than a header.
- [ ] At least one provider ships end to end with a live integration test, and adding a second provider is a new file implementing the interface, not a change to the credential store.

## Implementation Plan

Add a `secrets` config section — one word, because `envKeyToPath` treats the first underscore as the section separator, the same rule that forced `outbound` rather than `outbound_http`. Then define the provider interface in a new `internal/secrets` package: fetch one secret by reference, report health, and nothing else. Keep it deliberately small; a provider that also lists, writes or rotates invites KilasFlow to become a secrets manager, which it should not.

Wire the master key first, because it has exactly one consumer and proves the provider interface end to end. `cmd/kilasflow/main.go` currently treats a missing key as a warning and runs with credential storage disabled — that behaviour is right and must be preserved for a deployment that configures nothing. It must not extend to a *configured* manager that is down: a transient network error at boot silently disabling every credential in the installation is far worse than refusing to start. Make the two cases distinguishable in code, not just in a log message.

Then references. Resolve them inside `GORMCredentialStore.Resolve`, after decryption and before the plaintext half is merged in, so the one documented exit path for secrets stays the one exit path. Add the tenant-scoped manager-binding model to `internal/repository/models.go`, and a cache in `internal/secrets` keyed by tenant and reference with a TTL from config.

The design decision worth settling here rather than discovering later: how a workflow refers to an external secret. n8n exposes a `$secrets.<provider>.<key>` expression root and restricts it to credential fields. KilasFlow could add a matching root to `rootValue` in `internal/expression/expression.go`, next to `$json`, `$env` and `$execution`. Recommend not doing that, at least not first. Put the reference in the credential, where it is resolved on a path that already exists and already governs who may read what; an expression root would let any workflow author interpolate an arbitrary secret into an HTTP body, and the redaction boundary would be the only thing standing between that and an execution record. If a `$secrets` root is added later for import compatibility, scope it to credential fields the way n8n does.

The provider question is a cost decision, so make it with evidence. Vault's KV v2 API is plain HTTP with a token header and needs no vendor SDK, so it can go through `internal/safehttp` and inherit the SSRF policy and egress control that everything else outbound already obeys. AWS Secrets Manager needs SigV4, which means either hand-rolled signing or the AWS SDK and the binary size that comes with it. Recommend shipping Vault first behind the interface, then deciding the cloud providers against a real request rather than in the abstract.

One trap to watch. `execution.Redact` catches values whose *key* looks sensitive or whose *shape* looks like a credential. A token fetched from a manager and placed into a request body under an innocuous field name matches neither test, so it will be persisted verbatim in the execution record. Cover this with a test before the feature is called done; the fix belongs with p1-6's redaction work, but the failure belongs to this ticket.

## Work evidence — LongtailSecrets (2026-09-06)

Shipped the reference mechanism end to end; the boot wiring is an integrator
step (main.go/config outside this slice — sketch in keysource.go header).

- internal/credentials/external.go (new): ext://<binding>/<key> shape +
  parse, Provider interface (fetch/health only), tenant-scoped Resolver with
  bounded TTL in-memory cache (memory only, never disk), ScrubResolved for
  known values bodies hide.
- internal/credentials/vault.go (new): Vault KV v2 over plain HTTP through
  safehttp (no SDK, no new deps — memory/licensing.md read). Second provider
  = one new file implementing Provider.
- internal/credentials/keysource.go (new): KeyFromManager with
  ErrManagerUnreachable (configured-but-down refuses boot, never degrades to
  ErrNoKey); KeyFromEnvironment refactored onto shared decodeKey, behavior
  identical (existing test green).
- internal/repository/credentials.go (narrow hook, ClaimTier cleared):
  Resolve merges then resolveExternal — stored row keeps the sealed
  reference, failures return no fields (never partial, never reference as
  plaintext); public-field references refused at write; tenant cache
  invalidation on credential/binding writes; binding CRUD + LookupBinding.
- internal/repository/models.go + migrations 000008 (both dialects, spaces):
  secret_bindings, unique (tenant_id, name). Number history: 000006 collided
  with VectorTier's vector_store, both landed on 000007, agreed split —
  000006 vector_store (theirs), 000008 secret_bindings (mine), 000007 free.
- Deviation: interface lives in internal/credentials, not a new
  internal/secrets package (ownership-dictated; ticket's "new file per
  provider" property holds). No `secrets` config section (config outside
  slice); Vault policy comes from the operator's outbound section via
  ResolverConfig. Never allow_private_networks: tests grant loopback via
  allowed_private_endpoints only.
- Tests: secret never in stored row (raw payload decrypts to ext://),
  tenant isolation (same binding name, own rows), cache TTL + binding-change
  invalidation, unwired store fails closed, redaction intact
  (Get/List/Redacted), Vault live-HTTP end to end incl. egress denial without
  the grant, ScrubResolved incl. body interpolation.
- Suites: internal/credentials, internal/repository, internal/database green.
- Docs: operate/security.md note (manager key + references + tokens).

## Work evidence — SurfaceWiring (2026-09-06, not started)

Budget forced sequencing: durable waits first. Secrets boot wiring untouched
this batch; mechanism (keysource/external/vault/binding layers by
LongtailSecrets) stands. Ticket stays doing. Next batch, in order:
- internal/config one-word `secrets` section (manager_addr,
  manager_token_env, master_key) + Validate rejects partial + regen via
  `go run ./scripts/config-reference.go`.
- cmd/kilasflow boot beside the env switch: build Vault provider, call
  Health, refuse startup joining ErrManagerUnreachable on any failure, never
  fall through to the no-key path; any error refuses boot.
- Tests: unreachable manager (127.0.0.1:1 + allowed_private_endpoints grant,
  never allow_private_networks) errors Is ErrManagerUnreachable; healthy stub
  returns the key; unconfigured keeps the env path.

## Work evidence — SurfaceFinish (2026-09-06, closing)

Boot + config slice; reference mechanism by LongtailSecrets (preserved, suites green). Per-box proof:

- Master key from manager, env path unchanged: `cmd/kilasflow/main.go masterKey()` — empty `secrets.manager_addr` delegates to `KeyFromEnvironment` exactly as before; configured addr builds a Vault provider over the instance egress policy. Proof: `TestMasterKeyKeepsTheEnvironmentPathWhenUnconfigured` (ErrNoKey unconfigured; 32-byte key via env) + `TestMasterKeyReadsFromAHealthyManager` (httptest Vault, key bytes equal).
- Unreachable refuses, never degrades: any provider-build/Health/fetch failure joins `ErrManagerUnreachable`; the boot switch only warns on `ErrNoKey`, which the manager path can no longer produce (empty reference is a boot refusal, and `config.Validate` rejects partial sections). Proof: `TestMasterKeyRefusesAnUnreachableManager` (127.0.0.1:1 + allowed_private_endpoints grant, never allow_private_networks; `errors.Is(err, ErrManagerUnreachable)`).
- Reference resolve on the Resolve path / tenant isolation / TTL cache / no-leak / live Vault + new-file provider: LongtailSecrets evidence above; preserved — `go test ./internal/credentials/ ./internal/repository/` green.
- Config: one-word `secrets` section (`manager_addr`, `manager_token_env`, `master_key`) + `Validate` rejects partial + `internal/config/secrets_test.go`. Reference regen: DatastoreFinish landed combined regen (last-regen-wins); `--check` clean.

Suites: `internal/config`, `cmd/kilasflow`, `internal/credentials`, `internal/repository` green. `go build ./...` green. No new deps (Vault over safehttp; licensing.md already read).
