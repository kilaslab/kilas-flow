## Scope

`KilasFlowClient` in `sdk/src/server.ts` exposes **16 methods against an API of 33 operations**. The half it covers is the half the embed demo needed; the half it omits is most of what a host application actually automates.

Present: `listWorkflows`, `getWorkflow`, `createWorkflow`, `updateWorkflow`, `deleteWorkflow`, `getWorkflowVersion`, `activateWorkflow`, `deactivateWorkflow`, `runWorkflow`, `listExecutions`, `getExecution`, `cancelExecution`, `executionEventsUrl`, `listCredentials`, `listSchedules`, `createEmbedSession`.

Absent entirely:

- **Credentials beyond listing** — `create-credential`, `get-credential`, `update-credential`, `delete-credential` and `test-credential`. The client can list credential names and cannot create one, so a host that provisions a tenant's integrations must drop to raw `fetch` for the most security-sensitive calls in the product. `test-credential` is the worst omission of the five: it is the only operation that tells a host whether a credential it just stored actually works.
- **Credential types** — `list-credential-types`, without which a host cannot render a credential form at all.
- **Schedules beyond listing** — `create-schedule`, `update-schedule`, `delete-schedule`.
- **The node catalogue** — `list-node-types`, `get-node-icon`, `load-node-property-options`, `get-expression-grammar`. A host building any workflow UI of its own has no typed path to the catalogue that UI must render.
- **n8n interop** — `import-workflow` and `export-workflow`, which is the migration path this whole programme exists to serve.
- **Liveness** — `get-health` and `get-ready`, which every deployment wrapper wants.

The client is hand-written against generated model types, and that is a deliberate and good decision — `sdk/orval.config.ts` generates types only, with the comment "Types only. The SDK writes its own request layer." The problem is not the hand-writing; it is that hand-writing has no feedback loop. `sdk/scripts/check-types.mjs` catches a *model* that drifts and says nothing about an *operation* that was never wrapped, so the gap is invisible to every check in the repository and grows silently each time a handler is added.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every operation the OpenAPI document declares has a corresponding client method, or an explicit, documented exclusion with a stated reason.
- [ ] Credential create, get, update, delete and test are all reachable through the client, and `test-credential` returns its `{ok, detail}` shape typed rather than as `unknown`.
- [ ] Schedule create, update and delete are reachable, completing the surface `listSchedules` starts.
- [ ] The node catalogue is reachable — node types, the icon route, dynamic option loading and the expression grammar — so a host can render its own workflow UI without raw `fetch`.
- [ ] Workflow import and export are reachable, and the import result's diagnostics and minted webhook URLs are typed rather than opaque.
- [ ] A test reads the OpenAPI document produced by `scripts/openapi-spec.mjs` and **fails when an operation exists that no client method covers and no exclusion list names**, so this gap cannot silently reopen.
- [ ] Methods added by this ticket follow the existing conventions exactly: `AbortSignal` last, `Promise<void>` for 204, RFC 9457 errors surfaced as `KilasFlowError`, no ambient credential lookup.
- [ ] The binary-returning icon route is handled honestly rather than forced into the JSON transport, and its content type and caching semantics are preserved.

## Implementation Plan

Do the coverage test first, before adding a single method. Written second it is a formality; written first it produces the exact list of what is missing, keeps producing it as the API grows, and turns this ticket from a judgement call into a checklist. It should read the generated document rather than a hand-maintained list, and its exclusion list should be short enough to review.

The transport is already right for almost everything. `Transport.request` sets `Accept: application/json`, adds `Content-Type` only when there is a body, maps 204 to `undefined`, parses `application/problem+json` into `KilasFlowError`, and combines a caller `AbortSignal` with a 30-second `AbortSignal.timeout`. Most new methods are one line each on top of it.

Two operations do not fit that mould and should not be bent into it.

`get-node-icon` returns an image with a strict CSP and a one-day immutable cache header, not JSON. Adding it to the JSON transport would either lose the content type or force the transport to grow a mode. Recommend the `executionEventsUrl` precedent instead: return a URL the caller uses directly, since a host rendering an icon wants a URL for an `<img>` far more often than it wants bytes.

`import-workflow` takes the raw n8n document as an opaque JSON value inside a typed envelope, and its response carries the `unsupported` diagnostics and the minted `webhooks` array. Type the envelope and the response fully; leave the n8n document itself `unknown`, because typing a foreign format the importer deliberately treats as untrusted input would be a false promise.

One boundary to respect while adding these. `internal/api/middleware/embed.go` denies `/workflows/import`, `activate`, `deactivate` and `DELETE` to embed sessions outright. The server client and the browser client are separate entry points for exactly this reason, and none of the operations added here belongs in `sdk/src/browser.ts`.

Do not add convenience layers in this ticket — no polling helper, no retry policy, no pagination auto-follow. The client's value is that it is a thin, predictable, typed shape over a documented API; V2-p10-7's cursor helper is the one exception and it is scoped there deliberately.

## Progress (SDKSurface, 2026-09-06)

Done. `KilasFlowClient` now covers all **46 contract operations** (`docs/.../api-contract.md`,
not the stale 33 in Scope): 44 request methods + 2 URL builders
(`executionEventsUrl`, new `nodeIconUrl`). Exclusion list is empty — every
declared operation is reachable, so the gate's `EXCLUSIONS` map documents the
empty state rather than hiding gaps.

- `sdk/src/server.ts` (+255): 29 new methods grouped by resource — workflow
  history (`listWorkflowVersions`, `publish/restoreWorkflowVersion` with optional
  audit reason, `listWorkflowPublishEvents`), full credential CRUD +
  `testCredential`/`testCredentialPayload` (typed `TestCredentialResource`),
  credential types, auth/keys (`login`, `logout`→204, `getMe`, `listApiKeys`
  returning the `{items}` envelope as-is, `createApiKey`, `revokeApiKey`,
  `createStreamTicket`), schedule CRUD, node catalogue, interop
  (`importWorkflow` keeps the n8n document `unknown`; `exportWorkflow` sends
  `format=n8n`), system (`getHealth`, `getReady`). `nodeIconUrl(type,
  {version, theme})` follows the `executionEventsUrl` precedent (binary route,
  no JSON transport). Conventions kept: `AbortSignal` last, 204→`void`,
  `KilasFlowError`, no ambient credentials, nothing added to `browser.ts`.
- Gate: `sdk/test/operation-coverage.test.mjs` owns the operation→method map and
  fails on any spec operation with no method and no justified exclusion, on
  stale map entries, and on methods missing from the prototype. Reads the live
  document via new `sdk/scripts/dump-openapi.mjs` (same build+boot helper as
  `check-types.mjs`). Negative-checked (dropped `get-ready` → gate fails naming
  it). `.mjs` because the SDK typechecks under `moduleResolution: bundler`,
  which leaves `node:` imports untyped (tried `@types/node`, reverted).
- `sdk/test/operations.test.ts`: 15 mock-transport tests per method group
  (endpoints, query/body shapes, 204s, id encoding, icon URL building).
- `sdk/README.md`: operation-surface table + URL-builder/`unknown`-envelope notes.
- Verified: `pnpm --dir sdk check && pnpm --dir sdk test` (40/40, 4 files)
  `&& pnpm --dir sdk build` all green.
- Left untouched per instructions: `version.ts`/`API_VERSION` (surface grew, so
  the `SDK_VERSION`+package.json bump enforced by `make sdk-version-check` is
  for the release step), apiKey convenience (FEAT-jq84xk), publish.
- Files touched (sdk/ only): `src/server.ts`, `README.md`,
  `test/operations.test.ts` (new), `test/operation-coverage.test.mjs` (new),
  `scripts/dump-openapi.mjs` (new).
