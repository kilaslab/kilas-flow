## Scope

`internal/config/config.go` defines a `Config` struct with **ten** sections: `server`, `database`, `security`, `outbound`, `webhook`, `embed`, `branding`, `execution`, `binary`, `log`. `config.example.yaml` documents **seven**. The three it omits are `outbound`, `webhook` and `embed`.

Two of the three missing sections are the product's security boundary.

`outbound` is `OutboundHTTP` — `allow_private_networks` defaulting to false, `allowed_hosts`, `max_redirects`, `max_response_bytes` and `timeout`. It is the SSRF egress policy applied to every workflow HTTP request through `internal/safehttp`. An operator reading the example file has no way to learn it exists, let alone that it has a default worth reviewing.

`embed` is `signing_key_env`, `allowed_origins` and `session_ttl`. `allowed_origins` is the allowlist that decides which pages may host the editor, and it **fails closed**: empty means embedding is disabled entirely. An operator who has read the example file and is trying to make embedding work has nothing to find.

This is not a one-off omission to patch; it is a class of defect that will recur every time the struct gains a field, because the example file is maintained by hand and by memory. The example has already drifted by three whole sections. The fix is to stop hand-maintaining it.

Several more configuration facts live only in source and only in comments. `envKeyToPath` treats the first underscore in an environment variable name as the section separator, so a section name must be a single word — which is why `OutboundHTTP` is keyed `outbound` and not `outbound_http`, and it is a trap for anyone adding a section. `KILASFLOW_WORKFLOW_ENV_*` is a deliberately separate prefix so a workflow expression can never read the DSN or the master key. `KILASFLOW_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `KILASFLOW_EMBED_SIGNING_KEY` are both optional at boot: a missing key logs a warning and disables the feature rather than refusing to start, which is right for a first run and is how an operator ends up with credential encryption silently off in production.

There is also nothing that tells an operator how to run this thing responsibly: no deployment topology, no statement of what the PostgreSQL tier unlocks, no backup or restore procedure, no upgrade path, and no security posture in one place. `FEAT-a94c8y` already carries the most important of those as an acceptance criterion — that a table prefix is a naming convention and not an isolation boundary, and that a dedicated schema plus a restricted role is the only configuration that genuinely isolates — but it is one line in one ticket rather than a page an operator will read.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The configuration reference is generated from `internal/config/config.go`, so a new field appears in the documentation without anyone remembering to add it, and a section can never again be absent.
- [ ] Every key documents its type, its default, its environment-variable name and whether it is required, including all ten sections, and the generated reference is checked in the V2-p10-1 pipeline so a struct change with no regenerated reference fails the run.
- [ ] `config.example.yaml` is either generated from the same source or removed in favour of the reference, so the repository never again holds two disagreeing descriptions of the same struct.
- [ ] The single-word section rule imposed by `envKeyToPath` is documented where somebody adding a section will see it.
- [ ] The boot behaviour for a missing encryption key and a missing embed signing key is documented, including exactly what capability is silently lost in each case.
- [ ] Deployment topologies are documented — single container with SQLite, container with external PostgreSQL, and shared-customer-database with the `kflow_` prefix — with what each one gives up.
- [ ] The security posture is one page: the SSRF policy, the embed origin allowlist, the internal-database guard, credential sealing, and the statement that a table prefix is a naming convention and not an isolation boundary.
- [ ] Backup, restore and upgrade are documented for both drivers, including what to do about the data volume before pulling a newer image.

## Implementation Plan

Generate the reference; do not write it. A small Go program that walks the `Config` struct by reflection, reads the `koanf` tags and the doc comments, and emits Markdown into the docs site is perhaps a hundred lines, and it is the only version of this that stays true. Emit it into `docs/` and check it in CI the way the API client is checked — regenerate, compare, fail on difference — reusing the pattern `web/scripts/check-api-client.mjs` already establishes.

That approach needs the doc comments on the config structs to be good, since they become user-facing text. Several already are. Reading them with that in mind, and improving the ones that are terse, is part of this ticket rather than a follow-up.

Then decide what happens to `config.example.yaml`. Two workable answers and one bad one. Generating it from the same walk keeps a copy-and-edit starting point, which operators genuinely want. Deleting it in favour of the reference is simpler and removes the drift surface entirely. The bad answer is keeping it hand-maintained beside a generated reference, which reproduces exactly the divergence this ticket exists to close. Recommend generating it, with a header saying it is generated.

For the operator prose, write from what the smoke scripts already prove rather than from intent — `scripts/smoke-postgres.sh` is a working description of the PostgreSQL topology, and `scripts/smoke-docker.sh` encodes the volume-permission behaviour a bind-mount user will hit.

Be careful to document the PostgreSQL tier as it is on the day of writing, not as p6 will leave it. `database.max_open_conns` defaults to 1 for PostgreSQL too while `execution.max_concurrent` defaults to 10, and V2-p6-3 exists because that makes every current concurrency claim a no-op. Say what is true today and link the ticket that changes it; a documentation ticket that describes an unbuilt future in the present tense is worse than one that describes a limitation.

One judgement to record explicitly: the shared-customer-database topology is the one this product's ICP most wants and the one with the sharpest failure mode. `FEAT-a94c8y` and `FEAT-k65hqv` between them settle that the prefix is not a boundary and that a dedicated schema with a restricted role is. That has to be the recommendation on the page, stated plainly, not a caveat at the bottom.

## References

- `internal/config/config.go` — the ten-section `Config` struct, `EnvPrefix`, `envKeyToPath` and the single-word rule at line 81, and the koanf precedence chain.
- `config.example.yaml` — the seven sections it documents, against the struct's ten.
- `cmd/kilasflow/main.go` — `workflowEnvironment`, `databaseGuard`, `outboundPolicy`, and the warn-and-continue behaviour for absent keys.
- `internal/safehttp/safehttp.go` — what the `outbound` section actually governs.
- `internal/embed/embed.go` — `allowed_origins` failing closed, and the session lifetime cap.
- `internal/database/database.go` — the SQLite connection pin, the DSN pragmas, and `Migrate`.
- `scripts/smoke-postgres.sh`, `scripts/smoke-docker.sh` — working descriptions of two topologies.
- `.pine/tickets/FEAT-a94c8y.md` — the prefix-is-not-a-boundary statement this page must carry.
- `.pine/tickets/FEAT-gvn62x.md` — V2-p6-1, versioned migrations, which the upgrade page depends on and must not pre-announce as done.
- `web/scripts/check-api-client.mjs` — the generate-and-compare pattern the reference check should copy.

## Work notes (2026-09-06, OperatorGuide)

Done as specified, with two deviations from the ticket text where the tree had
moved on:

- The ticket says ten sections / seven in the example. The struct now holds
  fourteen sections (server, database, security, auth, outbound, webhook,
  embed, branding, execution, history, sql, credential, binary, log) and the
  hand example covered ten (missing outbound, webhook, sql, credential). The
  generator covers all fourteen — forty-four keys — so the count mismatch is
  closed by construction, not by patching.
- The ticket says `database.max_open_conns` defaults to 1 for PostgreSQL too.
  That is no longer true: `Database.PoolSize` derives the pool from
  `execution.max_concurrent` plus headroom (clamped 4-50) when unset, and
  `database.Open` applies it; only SQLite is pinned to 1. The deployment page
  documents the derivation as it is today and links the roadmap V2-p6-3 entry
  and FEAT-a94c8y for the remaining tier work. Migrations are also already
  versioned per dialect (000001-000004, sqlite+postgres), so the upgrades page
  describes the runner rather than promising one.

Decisions:

- `config.example.yaml` is GENERATED (recommended option): same walk as the
  reference, with a header saying to copy it to config.yaml and change values
  there. No hand-maintained drift surface remains. Rich prose from the old
  hand file was migrated into struct doc comments first, so nothing was lost.
- Check is a `--check` flag (`make generate-config-reference-check`, drift job
  in CI), the boring Go-native version of the check-api-client.mjs
  generate-and-compare pattern — no Node needed, since the generator reads
  source and defaults only.
- Generator fails on a field without a koanf tag or doc comment, and on a
  `requiredConditions` entry matching no field, so a new setting cannot ship
  undocumented and the required map cannot drift.
- Reference page lives at `docs/.../operate/configuration-reference.md`
  (sidebar order 3); the old `configuration.md` stub became the
  `Configuration` guide (order 2), `upgrades.md` became `Backups and
  upgrades` (order 5). No `ops/` directory was created — `operate/` is the
  existing convention.
- Parent-steered n8n references (local checkout, design-refs INDEX, Context7):
  assessed as not applicable to this slice — no agent/tool/memory IA or editor
  work here. No branding, style or text taken from any reference; no new
  dependencies (stdlib only), so memory/licensing.md needed no exception.

Verification: `go test ./internal/config/ ./scripts/` green; `go vet` clean;
`gofmt` clean; generated YAML parses (repo YAML lib) and loads via
`config.Load` with documented defaults (covered by
`scripts/config-reference_test.go`, including the outbound/embed spot
checks); `--check` proven to fail on a stale file and pass after regenerate;
`pnpm build` in docs/ green with all internal links valid (27 pages,
including the new reference).

Handoff: PersistenceTier adds a `TablePrefix` field to the Database struct
next (sequenced after this ticket's comment pass). They run
`go run ./scripts/config-reference.go` afterwards and give the field a full
doc comment — it becomes reference text automatically.
